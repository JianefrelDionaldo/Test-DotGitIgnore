# Module 218: Gitignore

In this module, I was assigned to implement the [.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Node.gitignore) file template in my working directory to ignore confidential files in the project. This repository is intended solely for educational purposes and is not for commercial use.

## Reference

The `.gitignore` template used in this project is sourced from the [GitHub gitignore repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore), specifically the [Node.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Node.gitignore) file, which is maintained by the [GitHub](https://github.com/github) team.
